# Clinical Judgment

Personal data is defined in UK law as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person". See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/ for more details.

This form has been designed to avoid deliberately or inadvertently collecting personal data. This is why, for example, age is collected in 5-year bands, countries are grouped into regions and less common medical specialties are grouped into "other". This is to avoid an individual clinician being identifiable by a combination of factors and hence it is not "personal data".

Nonetheless, the following information describes what to expect us to do if personal information is accidentally entered onto this online survey.

What information we collect, use, and why
We collect or use the following information for research or archiving purposes:·
-    Age in 5-year bands, gender, country/region of qualification and practice, medical specialty.

This form has been designed to avoid deliberately or inadvertently collecting personal data. However, if we suspect that any information entered onto the form, alone or in combination, leads to someone being identifiable, we will anonymise that response. We will do so by permanently removing information from that response until the individual is no longer identifiable (eg by removing medical specialty or country/region of qualification).

From this point we would no longer hold any personal data. All subsequent use of data will be of anonymised data, which is not personal data. We will publish the anonymised data in a public respository (such as github). The anonymised data will be kept indefinitely.

Our lawful bases for collecting or using personal information for research or archiving purposes are:
